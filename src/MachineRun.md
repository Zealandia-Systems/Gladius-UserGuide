# Machine Run

Before running up the machine we reccomend you follow the startup procedure and spindle warm up below.

## Startup Procedure
    Turn on your Machine at the controller
    Make sure the USB is connected to the Computer
    Connect to your machine through Gladius
    Home the machine
    Run a tool change to set machine work co-ordinates
    Run the XYZ Probe, or manually set work coordinates
    Press X0Y0 and Z0 to move the machine to work coordinate origin to verify position.
    Ready to go! Run your GCode

## Spindle Warmup
The warm up should be performed before use to increase the longevity of your machine. Each stage should be held for 120 seconds (two minutes). Macro link [here]
